"cargo new ___" - creates a new project with target name after new
"cargo build" - used within cargo project, builds project into executable into target/debug/
  - the "--release" flag can adds extra optimizations and exe lands in target/release/
  - does take longer than build, used primarily for release versions of a project
"cargo run" - used within cargo project, builds AND runs project in one step
"cargo check" - used within cargo project, builds project but does not produce executable
"cargo update" - ignores Cargo.lock and updates dependencies to their most recent version (w/ exceptions)
  - if you include:
	rand = "0.8.3"
  update will only update to the latest 0.8.x and won't move to a later version such as 0.9.x
  - to update to a later version, you must go into Cargo.toml and update the line:
	rand = "0.9.0"

In order to add additional library crates, list them under [dependencies] in Cargo.toml
  - library crates are separate from binary crates (like projects) in that they cannot be
    executed without a binary crate calling them

Cargo.lock will ship with a project in order to make sure that library crate versions used by Cargo
are the same that were intended by the project dev instead of the latest version in order to
maintain cross-platform compatibility
